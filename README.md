# This repository will contain data and  python codes important in using multiple hydrophones to localize sound sousrces.
# Exercise #1

## Problem statement:

### A two hydrophone array receives signals that are recorded in a stereo wave file.
### The array is specified thusly:
###    Separation between the two hydrophones: 1.1 m
###    The array is oriented with the L channel -> Right channel axis rotated in a horizontal plane 60 deg clockwise from North.
###    The speed of sound is: 1485 m/s
    
## The question:
###    For each of the 4 calls in the wav and lable files, what are the likely bearing angles relative to North for the signals received in each call.
